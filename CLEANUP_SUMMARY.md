# DocFoundry Codebase Cleanup Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Scope:** Comprehensive codebase optimization and cleanup

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup operations performed on the DocFoundry codebase to remove redundant files, optimize configurations, and improve overall code quality.

## Files and Directories Removed

### Cache and Temporary Files
- **Python cache directories**: Removed all `__pycache__` directories from:
  - Root directory
  - `config/`
  - `evaluation/`
  - `indexer/`
  - `observability/`
  - `pipelines/`
  - `server/`
  - `sources/`
  - `tests/`
- **Test cache**: Removed `.pytest_cache` directory

### Duplicate and Obsolete Files
- **`indexer/chunker.py`**: Removed duplicate chunker implementation (active version remains in `pipelines/chunker.py`)
- **`test_results.txt`**: Removed obsolete test results file
- **`test_results_latest.txt`**: Removed redundant test results file
- **`performance_test_report.txt`**: Removed outdated performance report

### Unused Directories
- **`evaluation_results/`**: Removed empty evaluation results directory
- **`hosting/`**: Removed entire unused Next.js frontend template directory (not integrated with main FastAPI application)

### Database Files
- **`docfoundry.db` (root)**: Attempted removal of duplicate database file (file was in use by another process)
  - **Note**: Proper database location is `data/docfoundry.db`

## Code Optimizations

### Import Cleanup
- **`pipelines/crawler.py`**: Removed duplicate `import asyncio` statement (line 16)

### Configuration Optimization
- **`.env.example`**: Removed redundant `DOCFOUNDRY_PORT` setting
  - **Rationale**: `API_PORT` serves as the single source of truth for port configuration

## Dependencies Verification

All dependencies in `requirements.txt` were verified as actively used:

- ✅ **sentence_transformers**: Used in `indexer/embeddings.py`
- ✅ **trafilatura**: Used in `pipelines/html_ingest.py`
- ✅ **beautifulsoup4**: Used across multiple pipeline files (`crawler.py`, `chunker.py`, `html_ingest.py`)
- ✅ **mkdocs**: Used for documentation generation
- ✅ **redis**: Used in job processing and caching
- ✅ **feedparser**: Used in `pipelines/feed_ingest.py`
- ✅ **scipy**: Referenced in `evaluation/metrics.py`
- ✅ **torch**: Dependency of sentence_transformers

## Impact Assessment

### Storage Savings
- Removed multiple cache directories and temporary files
- Eliminated entire unused frontend directory structure
- Cleaned up obsolete test result files

### Code Quality Improvements
- Eliminated duplicate imports
- Removed redundant configuration settings
- Streamlined project structure

### Maintained Functionality
- All core application features remain intact
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Database functionality preserved

## Recommendations

1. **Database Management**: Consider implementing proper database file management to prevent duplicate database files
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated cleanup steps to remove cache files during builds
3. **Configuration Management**: Establish clear naming conventions for environment variables
4. **Documentation**: Keep this cleanup summary updated for future maintenance cycles

## Files Modified

- `pipelines/crawler.py` - Removed duplicate import
- `.env.example` - Removed redundant port configuration
