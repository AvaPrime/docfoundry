# DocFoundry Comprehensive Code Analysis Framework

## Overview
This document provides a systematic approach to analyzing the DocFoundry codebase across multiple dimensions including code quality, security, performance, and architecture.

## 1. Initial Repository Assessment

### 1.1 Repository Structure Analysis
```bash
# Commands to analyze repository structure
find . -type f -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" | wc -l
find . -name "*.md" | head -10
ls -la
cat README.md
cat package.json || cat requirements.txt || cat Cargo.toml
```

**Key Areas to Examine:**
- Project structure and organization
- Technology stack identification
- Dependency management
- Documentation presence
- Configuration files
- Build and deployment scripts

### 1.2 Technology Stack Identification
- **Backend Framework:** (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Express, etc.)

```

### 2.2 Code Complexity Analysis
**Metrics to Evaluate:**
- Cyclomatic complexity

```bash
npx complexity-report src/
```

- [ ] API security (proper HTTP methods, CORS)

**Frontend Security:**
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] Content Security Policy
- [ ] Secure cookie handling
- [ ] Sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Third-party library vulnerabilities

### 4.2 Dependency Security
```bash
# Python
pip-audit
safety check

# JavaScript
npm audit
yarn audit
```

### 4.3 Authentication and Authorization
- JWT token handling
- Password hashing strategies
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- API authentication methods

## 5. Architecture Assessment

### 5.1 System Design Evaluation
**Questions to Address:**
- Is the architecture scalable?
- Are there clear separation of concerns?
- Is the system maintainable?
- How well does it handle errors?
- Is it testable?

### 5.2 Design Patterns Usage
- MVC/MVP/MVVM patterns
- Repository pattern
- Factory patterns
- Observer patterns
- Dependency injection

### 5.3 Microservices vs Monolith
- Service boundaries
- Data consistency
- Communication patterns
- Deployment complexity
- Monitoring and logging

## 6. Documentation Review

### 6.1 Code Documentation
- [ ] README.md completeness
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Inline code comments
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] Setup and installation guides
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

### 6.2 User Documentation
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Feature documentation
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides

## 7. Testing Analysis

### 7.1 Test Coverage Assessment
```bash
# Python
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
coverage html

# JavaScript
npm test -- --coverage
```

### 7.2 Test Quality Review
**Unit Tests:**
- [ ] Adequate test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Test case diversity
- [ ] Edge case coverage
- [ ] Mock usage appropriateness

**Integration Tests:**
